üêæüì∏ Dog vs. Cat Classification: Transfer Learning using Machine Learning ü§ñ

Experience the world of image classification with our Dog vs. Cat Classification project. This GitHub repository is your gateway to building a powerful machine learning model using transfer learning, enabling accurate identification of whether an image contains a dog or a cat.

üîç Project Highlights:

-Transfer Learning Techniques: Explore the efficiency of pre-trained models like VGG16, ResNet, or MobileNet for image classification tasks, reducing the need for extensive training data.

-Dataset Preprocessing: Learn the essential steps for preparing a dataset of dog and cat images, ensuring optimal model training and generalization.

-Fine-tuning Strategies: Dive into the art of fine-tuning pre-trained models to adapt them specifically for the dog vs. cat classification task, striking the right balance between feature extraction and model specialization.

-Model Evaluation: Employ evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall to gauge the performance of your model on distinguishing between dogs and cats.
